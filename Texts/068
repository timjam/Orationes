.The Prologue.
.
The Metals all, in first place Gold,
Salute you; and have made so bold
As to invite you to this place
Where they intreat of you this grace
To list a while and hear what they
Haue for themselves each one to say.
Gold the Solist to content
Hath his wit, and forces bent.
Silver Luna’s friends to please
Counts her greatest pains but ease.
And Quicksilver that nimble thing
Mercury strives to make their King.
Saturn he is all for Lead
With his melancholy head.
Iron should bear the bell away
Could but Mars his arm here sway.
Iove favours Tinn; and he in sight
Plays least, and so seems Iove to slight.
Venus would that her delight
Brass, and Copper, made so bright
By the maids ’gainst Christmas time
Should above the others climb.
Touchstone tries all by his test
And Gold is found to be the best.
