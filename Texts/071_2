G. A ring with gold? ’Twill be to your cost. Hold your fingers, or
I’ll be about your ears. Ne’er trust me if you be not well paid
Silver, if you meddle.
S Nay if you be so able, I’ll not strain you any further, neighbour
Gold. For then I am sure to goe to the wall. For a woman is
the weaker vessel.
Q. Why I hope you will not stand out in the quarrel. You’ve known 
Gold beaten ere now.
G. Talk not, Quicksilver. I’m sure Quicksilver hath been beaten as
oft as I. Why Silver is never without a mark. And therefore
hold your tongue, Quicksilver, lest I spit in thy face.
Q. Very trim, very trim. Spit in my face? not so fast, not a bit
before supper.
G. Nor before breakfast. For, if I spit on thee fasting, I shall kill thee.
Q. Kill not mee, Gold. For if you doe, you shall see Quicksilver will
give you a medicine for the itch. If you kill me, you will be hang’d in
chains, neighbour Gold, I’ll assure you.
I. Nay let mee alone with Gold. If he meddle I’ll cut him in pieces,
down with him, and stamp him under my feet that’s flatt.
G. You are a hot shot. I think if thou wert hang’d, thou wouldst
make good bacon, if thou wert not rusty Iron.
I. Good Gold, not too much rusty Gold.
G Had I the stomack of an Ostrich, I should never digest this Iron
But if I were in the vein, or mine, or so bent to contend with you,
I should give you a token of my courage.
B. Nay Brass must be the man for tokens. And Gold I am sure 
you are in a better vein, and mine always then any of us.
And therefore I think you need not fear.
Q. In a good mind? very good, very good. Then I think it were good hanging.
G. Well, Sirs, I could never yet hope that you would be turn’d to 
Gold since my friend Midas died. For you haue ever since
made all that attempted any such matter like yourselves, base, and
beggarly. Let us therefore cho<ex>o</ex>se some honest, and equal Arbitra-
-tor, which may make an end of our contention.
L. Think you wee’ll put up this, Gold? You say the Chimists
