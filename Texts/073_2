T. Now next try on – Away Lead. Thou art as dull as a Dutchman.
And they that thee doe take for ought but dross
Their wit, like thee, is heavy, dull, and gross.
S. Nay let him be what he will, so he be not a Sowgelder
T. And who are you? B. I’m Brass the bold, and strong.
T. True indeed. I smell him already. Out upon him he stinks like a
Tinker. Away with him to Banbury, away,
For never yet could Brass bear any sway.
And now to you, Quicksilver – Heigh day! – Heigh! – What  have
I got an Ele by the tail? – Hee’ll never be touch’d, nor taken – You’re
too quick to be good. And soe I leave you. And now to the rest – O
madam Silverpin is it you? Let me embrace you. I am glad to finger
you. Let me salute you. This is an honest, no adulterate wench. And I
know all men desire to have to doe with her. Shee’s a fair witty com-
panion at boord. There’s salt in her indeed; shee alwais savours
well. –  But stay awhile. – What’s the last? – Ho! ho! Nihil est 
præstantius auro. Tis Gold. This is the purum metallum. A man well 
tried, the very Quintessence of all.
This is He that strange things can.
This can make a beast a man.
By the vertue of his might
He can make an ass a Knight.
This can urge a Prince to wedd,
And bring the coyest to his bedd.
This can make, or marr a King.
Pandora like’t gives every thing.
This can Towers, and Cityes win.
This can let the Frenchman in.
When Iove from heaven escapes doth make
He to himselfe this form doth take.
Beware then Virgins to your happs
When Gold doth shower into your lapps.
If one be sick, and full of smart,
This is cordiall for the heart.
