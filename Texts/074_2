Q. Marry I think to take them away out of their Country.
Ambo. Only our service, Sr. They unmask.
G. Aurelia, my sister welcome. He salutes her
S And Argentea mine She salutes her.
G. Thanks to you both. This grace came happily. Sisters sit down
For all things now I see consent
To our happy new Instalment.
T. Nay royal King by your leave
With pardon this I crave
Equal licence I may haue
As the Metals, soe the sounds to try
Which hath the sweetest symphony.
And first, mistress Argentea, let me hear your voice. Come tune
your silver pipes. [Shee sings] Indeed shee hath a sound, and
sweet voice. Now Aurelia lett’s hear you [Shee sings] Indeed
tis excellent! This song deserves gold. Come, take your places.
You here, and you there. [He puts one by gold, t’other by Silver.
G. Thanks equal Iudge. Now I desire
That every cause had such a trier
Strife then should end, and all outrage.
And wee should haue a golden age.
Now because new Kings haue always some new Officers: Touch-
-stone henceforth for your worth, I make you Lord Chancellor,
Keeper of our Seal; and one of our privy Councell. Let Latin
be our Secretary: Pewter our Almoner: Alchimy our Cupbearer:
Steel our Carver. Copper and Tinn my Queens Embassadours.
For they best represent our Persons. Lead be you our Gentleman-
usher. Brass, be you our Trumpeter. Iron be you of our Guard.
And you – S. Nay let me dispose of him. G. You shall.
S. Then Quicksilver be you my Page. G. The night grows on.
Letts goe. You fair Queen ere long I’ll meet
At Your Court in Silverstreet.
T. Gentleman-Usher avoid the Room.
