Nay Christmas had been starv’d to death
Were’t not for his quickening breath.
Thus then here I doe create
Him sole ruler of the State.
And by this my just decree
Gold your Soveraign Leige shall be.
Amongst the Metalls he shall sway
The Scepter. When He speaks, obey.
From his laws yee shall not sever,
But the golden rule keep ever.
S. To your election I doe yield.
Gold is captain of the field.
All sing.
B. A round, I. A round. Q. A round in a ring.
L Let us B. Here crown. S. Gold our King
[Touchstone crowns Him.]
Om: Vivat Rex! Vivat Rex! T. But stay.
Now because Gold’s seldom seen
Silver her I make his Queen
For, if perchance He prove unkind,
Silver shee can change his mind.
[He crowns, & places Her by Gold.]
Om: Vivat Rex et Regina! Vivat Rex et Regina!
Enter Aurel: & Argent: masked singing ye Wassel.
T. But heark! Behold new mirth to this celebration – What, and whence
are yee. Au: Virgins from the Nunneries of Poissy.
Q. Ha ha he! That’s strange I’faith. Virgins from Poissy?
Au. Not so strange as true Sr. T. What’s your business here?
Ar: Wee come a pilgrimage from Poissy to offer at the shrine
T. Of what I pray? Ar: Of Gold and Silver
T. What doe you mind to offer?
