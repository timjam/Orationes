Q. Ordinance? what’s that? a Gun? If it be, he’s no such strong
piece of mans flesh. I haue known him sett in the stocks ere
now.
S Indeed, Iron, I think this is but a meer crack of yours. You’ll
overshoot yourselves presently, but I’ll teach you to chamber your
tongs. I. Nay I am the man for tongs.
G. Tis true, Iron, you are a double tongued slave. But I hope your
pair of tongs shall never carry away the cause, if you goe to plead
it once
Q. Why I hope you will grant that Iron is excellent at the Barr
G. I grant that. Yet I think he is but a poor Lawyer. He can make 
a bill indeed, but it is alwaies forged
Q. If it be forg’d, I am sure gold is coin’d. Aside.
G. I am the man must doe the deed. I know the Lawyer will doe
more for Gold, then for any of you all. They loue me soe they’ll
doe nothing without mee
S. It may be then, Gold, you think to prevail at the Common law,

Q. Indeed that’s hard to doe. But Silver hath met with you there,
Gold. What sayest to this? not a word? I think thou art quite

be Courtiers enow to help me out, and Ladyes too, and You also,
Silver, for a need.
L Gold is in sometimes upon occasion, and other times out upon
use, if the Officers can get the Souldiers to stay for their pay.
And yet I think there are as many would keep you in, as lett you out
But let’s pass from this lawcase. For I think you all talk, and talk, &amp;
know not the Law. Let’s try our worth by force of arms.
G I am content. You shall see what arms I bear. Offers to strike
B Nay, good Gentlemen, be quiet, I pray. I poor Brass shall sound
presently, if you fall to striking.
Q. What durst you not buckle, Brass,? Fly Brass, fly, If you be
such a coward: if you loue your ease, begone
B. Well, call me coward, I care not, so I haue not the cowards blow.
S. Come, Gold, a ring with you
