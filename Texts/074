L. Room for the Queen there. Stand bare, stand bare.
They goe off in order.
G.Gentlemen & Ladyes.
I know you are loth with me to part:
The loss of mee goes to your heart.
Why I hast then if you ask,
Know this night there is a mask
At Court. Where I your great King
Must see the Ladyes dance the ring.
But when I’m gone, I am not lost.
I will returne unto your cost.
In next Spring Gold will be here
Even in this Schoole I will appear.
To which if that your liking stands
Express your hearts now by your hands.

Epilogue
The Metalls striving, Y’haue all seen to day
the Scepter ’bove each other here to sway.
Steel’s laid aside; because he sought the race
Of Kings to cut off from their royal Grace
By i’rn-side Cromwell backt. Bradshaw you see
Set out by Brass. But he noe King could be.
Quicksilver shew’d Peters, who moved fast
Railing ’gainst Kings: in bloud he breath’d his last
On Charing-cross, contemn’d by God, and Man,
After whose pipe did dance the Puritan.
King Charles pure gold now rightly sitts inthron’d
Whom Iustice Touchstone gloriously hath crown’d.
Lead was too dull; Brass impudently bold
Iron too hot a Kingdom still to hold.
Thus proud rebellion never long can stay,
Which doth through God, and Majesty make way.
