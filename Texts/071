and Wee be base, and beggarly. The Chimists indeed seem soe: but with
out doubt They counterfit Gold. But if wee choose for an indifferent
Iudge betwixt us, some honest man, you shall be none, Gold.
G Why? I hope I was never yet known to be corrupted?
L. That’s a question. But you haue been often known to corrupt others.
I. Be advis’d by me, Sirs, and choose Steel for our judge. He’s one
of a quick understanding, and sharp wit.
G. He is so. But hang him, he steel’d that fatal ax in the mur-
der of that late gracious king Charles the first. Besides he’ll
be partial on your side. For you, Iron, haue always back’d him. Wit
ness ironside Cromwell, who cut the throat of King, and Kingdom.
Q. Very trim, very trim. One of Irons companions made a judge?
Why you are both shamefull lyars, and have both wone the
Whetstone. What think you of Pewter?
L Hang him platter face. Wee shall haue a fine piece of service
if He be Iudge. His mind is alwaies in patinis.
B Ha ha he. A Terence for Lead there. His plumbeous cerebrosity
spouts latin.
L. Mas! and well remembred. What if wee choose Latine for our Iudge?
B. Out upon him! Fye, fy upon him, out: he’ll puzzle us all. Wee
shall not be able to understand him.
S What if you choos Alchimy? He is indifferent on both sides, a
church Latitudinarian
L. Yes, yes. He’s the worse for that. I cannot endure one that is a
Iack on both sides. He’ll ne’er be good, Silver, he is so like you.
I. Soft, soft. I think the Philosophers stone would be the best Iudge
when all’s done.
Q. Ay marry Sr: But where shall wee find him? There’s many
a wise Gentleman hath lost himselfe, and all that he had in His
search, and could never yet find Him out. I think he is the man
in the moon known only to the fanatick heads, and Vertuosos.
Nay suppose Wee should by great chance stumble on this stone, what
would be issue? He would even turn you all into Gold.
S. Choose, Sirs, whom yee will, all’s one to mee.
Silver will stand upon her puritye.
