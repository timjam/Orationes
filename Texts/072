hence with a powder. Enter Touchstone. But
see, here he is in truth. He hath saved Lead the wearing of his heeles.
T. How now my ladds of metal? What at jarrs? What rule wth you here?
B. Marry none, Sr, for all’s out of square about rule.
And You are he whom wee all choose
An equall judge this knot to loose
Which of all us Metalls may
Henceforth bear the bell away.
Your hand, fair Sr, quickly can
Point forth to us who’s the man.
At your first touch it will appear
Who’s most fitt to domineer.
Only I this caution make
Whom you touch, first, Him you take.
I hope hee’ll touch me first [Aside] Your hand, good Sr, your hand.
T. Not soe bold brazen face.
For You, with Lead, Iron, &amp; the rest
I’ll touch, and try; but choose the best.
And first let Iron come to his test.
I. Here I am Sr. I’ll rather bend than break
And now, or never, for cold Iron speak.
Q. So hoe! a plot! a plot! I fear a plot.
B. Why what’s the matter, nimble? What means this starting?
Q. A plot! I fear a plot. This is not the true Iudge.
B. Why pretty motion? why?
Q. Because I think it is not Touchstone, but Loadstone. Because he
draws Iron first unto him.
B. And well observ’d i’faith. Wee shall know that by his long, and close
cleaving unto him.
T. Iron stand by. For here you shall not boast.
I’ th’ Kitchin with the spit goe rule the roast.
G. Soe hoe! He’s as true as touch.
L I think he’s turn’d Corncutter. There is nothing with him but
touch, and goe.
